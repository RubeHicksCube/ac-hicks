# Overview
Hi, my name is Andrew Hicks and I’m a computer networking professional with over 9 years of experience in the field. I currently work as a Systems Administrator in the United States Space Force, where I specialize in Computer Networking and Help Desk IT Support. I proudly serve as an E-5 (Sergeant) in the Space Force, though I started in the Air Force in 2014. In my free time, I enjoy riding motorcycles and drawing manga. I’m also an avid tech enthusiast and enjoy taking photos in my spare time. I’m always looking for new challenges and projects to take on, so feel free to get in touch if you have any opportunities you think I might be interested in.

# Military Service
In 2014 I joined the Air Force in the Cyber Transport field. This focuses on Computer Networking, but in 2021 I joined the Space Force and have been expanding my knowledge of everything the network touches.

# Personal Projects

#### 3D Print Server
I have made a print server for my 3D printer to print and monitor remotely from anywhere out of a raspberry pi.

#### Test Server
I use another raspberry pi for various functions, such as network monitoring, a server for my smart home devices, as well as some other home networking services.

#### Web Design
I drafted this website on a web server using Nginx, PHP, and installed WordPress from home, before publishing it to a hosting service.

#### Home Lab
I have my home server that hosts a Proxmox hypervisor for various virtual machines and host my NAS, router, data backups, and more.

#### HAM Radio
I’m currently studying for my Amature Radio Technician License to be used with HAM operators.

#### IT admin and security
All of these expand my horizons for professional services and concepts that I would use in my work. Allowing me to test and tinker and enjoy learning new processes.

# Other Interests
Outside of tech, I enjoy various other hobbies.

#### Photography
I have a diploma in photography, where I sometime to photoshoots of events, portraits, or landscapes on some of my adventures.

#### Graphic Design / Art
I wouldn’t really call myself an artist but I like to draw, where I was commissioned as a manga artist for a bit, and some other graphic design.

#### Motorcycles
I also love to ride motorcycles! I’ve been riding since I was very young, and have been my unit’s Motorcycle Safety Representative for many years now. I have wanted get certified as an instructor and share my passion with more and more poeple.

#### All of the above!
There are a lot of other things I love to do, but overall I’d like to say that I will never turn down trying anything at least once. The list of things I don’t like to do or haven’t done is much shorter than the list of everything else I have done!

I love to learn and try new things.

# Education

I earned my Cisco Certified Network Associate certification in 2016.
